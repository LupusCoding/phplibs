# PHP Libs
by LupusCoding

## General
Each library / API is in a ready-to-use state and has an example folder, with at least one example. Some of them also have PHPUnit tests.

## Current Packages
* Autoload
  * PSR-4 style autoloader with namespace to path mapping.
* Encoder
  * Simple API to encode data.
* EventPro
  * Simple API to handle events in php. Listen to and react on events by single method calls.
* Recaptcha
  * Simple library for easy google reCaptcha usage.
* Registry
  * API to temporarily register data to a global key-value store. No database is required because all data is stored in the object.
  
## Future Plans
* MicroController
  * Micro Service Controller and Service Interfaces to create Micro Service projects, according to standardized procedure.
* DBQM
  * (D)ata(B)ase (Q)uery (M)anager - Simple API to handle DB requests
* PluginProcessor
  * API to create plugin slots and to easily define the standard methods, per plugin.
* ShellProcessor
  * Easy-to-use API for creating PHP-based, console-executable scripts. For example: setups, cron jobs, etc.
